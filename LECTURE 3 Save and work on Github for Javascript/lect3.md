create a GitHub repository

To open js runtime environment at GitHub( it is same as what we have on vs code) : Click on “Code”—>”Codespaces”—>”Create Codespace on main” —>> code editor similar to vs code will open.

Now to use this workspace we need to install node.js:-  “View”—>”Command Palate”—>”Add Dev container Config file”—>”node.js and javascript”—> chose version—>Rebuild Now—>your runtime environment is ready

Now create a Folder and test.js file inside it and write your code and run it using terminal. (But progress is not showing in repo)

To save: Click on “Source Control icon”—>Select all the files that you want to save by clicking on + —> Write a commit message —>“Commit”—> Step-2 —> PUSH

Always remember to close the running machine.—> In the top-left corner of GitHub.com, select Three bars—> then click  Codespaces—>To the right of the codespace you want to delete, then click  Delete.

Performing above action wont delete any files. It will just close the running machine.
